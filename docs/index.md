# About

This documentation provides guidance for using the dual-channel FFT-Analyzer, a tool that allows users to select two channels from a .h5 signal file for signal processing. The tool offers various methods to process and display the results, with options to export the data. It was developed at TU Berlin for the course Python & Akustik.
