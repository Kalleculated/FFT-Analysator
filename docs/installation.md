# Installation

The FFT-Analyzer can be used through 3 different means:

1. Download the latest release on the GitHub repo and execute the .exe.
2. Download the source code, install the packages from the `requirement.txt`, navigate to the root directory and use the command `panel serve src\fft_analysator\app.py --autoreload`.
3. Alternatively you can download the source code and install the package by using the command `command`. Afterwards you can start the app by doing.
If you only want to use the API and are not interested in using the GUI, you can refer to the API documentation and either choose option 2 or 3.
