# Installation

The FFT-Analyzer can be used through 3 different means:

1. It is generally recommended to download the source code, install the packages from the `requirement.txt` by navigating to the root directory and using the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`, afterwards to start the app use `panel serve src\fft_analysator\app.py --autoreload`.
2. Alternatively you can download the source code and install the package by using the command `command`. Afterwards you can start the app by importing it and then using `fft_analysator.App().serve_app()`.
3. If you only want to use the API and are not interested in using the GUI, you can refer to the API documentation and either choose option 2 or 3.
